# Pi-Dash: A Minimalist Pi-hole Dashboard

Pi-Dash is a simple, lightweight dashboard for monitoring multiple Pi-hole instances. It provides a clean, at-a-glance, responsive view of your Pi-hole statistics.

## Features

- **Multiple Pi-hole Support:** Monitor all your Pi-hole instances from a single dashboard. You can add as many as Pi-hole's you want.
- **Dynamic Configuration:** Easily add, remove, or disable Pi-holes through a simple `config.json` file.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout works on both desktop and mobile devices, stacking cards vertically on smaller screens.
- **Real-time Statistics:** The dashboard automatically refreshes every second.
- **Lightweight and Fast:** Built with Flask and vanilla JavaScript, Pi-Dash is fast and has minimal dependencies.
- **Dark Mode:** Automatically switches theme based on your system preferences.

## Configuration

Before running the application, you need to create and configure the following files:

### 1. `config.json`

This file manages your Pi-hole instances and dashboard settings. Example:

```json
{
  "base_path": "/",
  "refresh_interval": 1000,
  "piholes": [
    {
      "name": "Primary",
      "address": "https://pi.hole/one",
      "password": "your_app_password_here",
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "name": "Secondary",
      "address": "https://pi.hole/two",
      "password": "your_app_password_here",
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

- **base_path**: (optional) The subpath where the application is hosted (e.g., `/pi-dash/`). Defaults to `/`.
- **refresh_interval**: (optional) How often the dashboard updates, in milliseconds (e.g., 1000 = 1 second).
- **piholes**: List of Pi-hole instances.
  - **name**: Display name for your Pi-hole (e.g., "Primary").
  - **address**: Full URL to your Pi-hole (e.g., "http://pi.hole").
  - **password**: Your Pi-hole API token/password.
  - **enabled**: Set to `true` to display the Pi-hole on the dashboard, or `false` to hide it.

### 2. `manifest.json` (Optional)

This file is for Progressive Web App (PWA) settings and icon. Example:

```json
{
  "name": "Pi-Dash",
  "short_name": "Pi-Dash",
  "description": "A simple dashboard to monitor Pi-hole status.",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#111827",
  "theme_color": "#06b6d4",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "https://pi.hole/admin/img/logo.svg",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/svg+xml"
    }
  ]
}
```

- **icons.src**: Replace with a direct link to your Pi-hole logo or preferred icon.
